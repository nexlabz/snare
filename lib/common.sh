# Most IOCs are plain strings. grep -F matches those with Aho-Corasick, in one
# pass, regardless of how many there are. Only the genuinely regex ones need
# -E. A line whose sole metacharacter is an escaped dot is a literal once the
# backslash is dropped.
# A pattern is a literal if every metacharacter in it is backslash-escaped:
# `global\['_t_s'\]` and `setup_bun\.js` are plain strings once unescaped,
# even though they look like regexes. Only patterns with a LIVE metacharacter
# -- `.*`, `?`, `|`, a character class -- actually need the -E engine, and
# those are the ones that backtrack across minified bundles.

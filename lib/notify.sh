## Malware was committed to this repository

**Status: removed.** The payload has been deleted. This notice exists so that
everyone with a local clone checks their own machine — cloning or simply
opening this repo was enough to execute it.

### What was here

Droppers of this family hide in one of two places:

- **\`.vscode/tasks.json\`** — a task with an innocuous label (e.g. \`eslint-check\`),
  marked \`"hide": true\` / \`"reveal": "never"\`, set to \`"runOn": "folderOpen"\`.
  **Opening the folder in VS Code runs it.**
- **A config file loaded by the build** (e.g. \`postcss.config.js\`) — the payload is
  appended after thousands of spaces on one line, so the file looks normal in an
  editor. It runs on \`next dev\` / \`next build\`.

The executed file is often disguised as an asset, e.g. \`public/fonts/*.woff2\`.
A genuine \`.woff2\` begins with the magic bytes \`wOF2\`; these begin with spaces.

**Neither route needs \`npm install\`.**

### What it does

It resolves its command-and-control address *from the Ethereum blockchain*
(transactions from \`0xa322E5f3D311D3080e6f0121063e9aDC2490Ef1a\` read via the
Blockscout API), decodes an IPv4 address out of them, downloads a second stage
and \`spawn\`s it detached. Observed second stage: a clipboard stealer capturing
everything copied. Because the C2 lives on-chain the attacker rotates it freely —
**blocking a single IP does not help.**

### Check your machine

\`\`\`bash
# running right now?  (macOS/Linux)
ps -eo pid,args 2>/dev/null | grep -E "node .*-e .*global\[" | grep -v grep
# Windows PowerShell:
#   Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | ? { $_.CommandLine -match 'node .*-e .*global\[' }

# your local clones
grep -rn "0xa322E5f3D311D3080e6f0121063e9aDC2490Ef1a" .
grep -rn "folderOpen" .vscode/tasks.json 2>/dev/null
head -c 4 public/fonts/*.woff2 2>/dev/null   # a real font prints wOF2
\`\`\`

### Then, in this order

**1. Rotate your credentials first.** Stealing them is what this family is *for* —
the file in the repository is delivery, not payload. Removing it does not
un-steal a token.

- **npm tokens first** — https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens — start with
  write / "bypass 2FA". A stolen npm token lets the worm publish trojanised
  versions of *your other packages* under your name. This is the step that
  stops one machine becoming a supply-chain incident.
- GitHub PATs and OAuth apps — https://github.com/settings/tokens — and SSH
  keys — https://github.com/settings/keys
- Cloud keys (AWS — check Secrets Manager per region — GCP, Azure)
- \`.env\` files in any project you had open, kubeconfig, Vault, database URLs,
  VPN, AI-service keys, wallet keys and seed phrases
- **Your clipboard.** This family has a documented clipboard stealer; a password
  pasted out of a manager while infected should be treated as seen.

**2. Check your own machine before you clean anything.** This family injects
into commits *from an already-infected machine*, so cleaning a repository while
your machine is still infected just re-injects into it.

\`\`\`bash
snare doctor          # this machine, persistence spots, your account
snare guard scan      # one-shot process check
snare rotate          # the checklist above, plus a GitHub audit
\`\`\`

**3. Delete your local clone and re-clone.** If history was rewritten a
\`git pull\` will conflict — you must re-clone, not pull.

**4. Check your GitHub account** for repositories, keys, OAuth apps or Actions
workflows you did not create. This family leaves behind a workflow that
exfiltrates secrets on every push, and it survives long after the dropper is
removed.

Scanned and cleaned with [snare](https://github.com/) — \`snare scan repo .\` to check your own clones.

Malware was committed into {repo}, which we both have access to. It has been
removed. There is a GitHub issue on the repo with the full write-up.

HOW IT INFECTED PEOPLE (neither step needs npm install):
1. .vscode/tasks.json - a hidden task with runOn:folderOpen. Simply OPENING
   the folder in VS Code executed it.
2. A build config file (e.g. postcss.config.js) with the payload appended
   after thousands of spaces on one line, so the file looks normal. It ran
   on every `next dev` / `next build`.
The executed file was disguised as a font: a real .woff2 starts with wOF2.

It pulls its command-and-control address from the Ethereum blockchain, so
blocking a single IP does not stop it. The second stage was a clipboard
stealer that captured everything copied.

  ps -eo pid,args 2>/dev/null || ps axww    # then look for: node -e ...global[
  grep -rn "0xa322E5f3D311D3080e6f0121063e9aDC2490Ef1a" .

     - Your clipboard: this family has a clipboard stealer, so anything you
       copied while infected should be treated as seen.

2. CHECK YOUR MACHINE before cleaning any repo - this family injects from an
   already-infected machine, so cleaning first just lets it re-inject:
     snare doctor
     snare guard scan
     snare rotate

3. Delete old clones and re-clone (a pull will conflict if history was
   rewritten - you must re-clone, not pull).

4. Check your GitHub account for repos, keys, OAuth apps or Actions workflows
   you did not create. This family leaves a workflow that exfiltrates secrets
   on every push and survives the dropper being removed.

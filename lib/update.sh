# The repository moved to the nexlabz organisation. GitHub redirects the old

# told you are on, and what `snare update` pulls.

# `cmd_update` — the refresh that feeds the "you are behind" notice reaches the
# network first, and a notice sourced from a hijacked remote is worse than no
# notice at all.

# on infected repositories, and a clean result is exactly what stops you
# looking further.
#
# So every command surfaces it, subject to three rules:
#   - it must never block or slow the command down, so the network check runs
#     detached and only a CACHED answer is read on the hot path;
#   - it must be quiet, so it prints one line and at most once a day;
#   - it must send nothing. The check is a git ls-remote against a public
#     repository — no identifiers, no telemetry, no phoning home.
